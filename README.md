### What is this?

This is an app built to display companies and their incomes using the provided API. The user can search for companies by their names, location and incomes.
The application was created with Angular version 8.2.14. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.20.

### Requirements

You need node.js and its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Get started

Clone the companies repository using git: `git clone https://github.com/AnnaZieminska/companies`

Change directory `cd companies`

### Installation

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. I use npm to manage the dependencies and recommend you to use it. To install all dependencies (might take a minute) run `npm install`.

### Run Application

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Live demo
